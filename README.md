High-Resolution Ecological Niche Model for Dengue Vectors in South Asia

Aedes aegypti & Aedes albopictus — MaxEnt Modeling at 1-km Resolution

This repository contains the code, processed data, and reproducible workflow used to generate the preliminary 1-km ecological niche model reported in:
Mainali, R. K. (2025). A High-Resolution (1-km) Ecological Niche Model for Dengue Vectors in South Asia.
See /report/ for the full document.
The goal of the project is to model broad-scale environmental suitability for dengue vectors using presence-only data and a transparent, fully documented MaxEnt workflow.

NOTE: I couldn't upload the data due to file size limitations, but the data can be accessed using the following link: <https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4xwdpgkn1ktk076mspxjb/AINVCV1fQ1Ohz4HGKkkhpzA?rlkey=wspa0w9es6zij386w0xc0zcwj&st=ta52ek3x&dl=0>
