High-Resolution Ecological Niche Model for Dengue Vectors in South Asia

Aedes aegypti & Aedes albopictus — MaxEnt Modeling at 1-km Resolution
This repository contains the code, processed data, and reproducible workflow used to generate the preliminary 1-km ecological niche model reported in:
Mainali, R. K. (2025). A High-Resolution (1-km) Ecological Niche Model for Dengue Vectors in South Asia.
See /report/ for the full document.
The goal of the project is to model broad-scale environmental suitability for dengue vectors using presence-only data and a transparent, fully documented MaxEnt workflow.
