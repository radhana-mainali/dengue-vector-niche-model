High-Resolution Ecological Niche Model for Dengue Vectors in South Asia

This repository contains the code, processed data, and reproducible workflow used to generate the preliminary 1-km ecological niche model reported in the following preprint:
Mainali, R. (2025). A High-Resolution (1-km) Ecological Niche Model for Dengue Vectors in South Asia.

The full preprint document is also available in the report folder of this repository.
The goal of the project is to model broad-scale environmental suitability for dengue vectors using presence-only data and a transparent, fully documented MaxEnt workflow. This is a work in progress.

NOTE: I couldn't upload the data due to file size limitations, but the data can be accessed using the following link: <https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4xwdpgkn1ktk076mspxjb/AINVCV1fQ1Ohz4HGKkkhpzA?rlkey=wspa0w9es6zij386w0xc0zcwj&st=ta52ek3x&dl=0>
